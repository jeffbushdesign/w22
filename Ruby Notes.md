# Ruby Notes

print "Give me a number: "
You add a space at the end for some reason, I guess to move the prompt a bit away from the text

gets.chomp.to_i

# chomp

Removes the \n new line after a gets input

# .to_i

Converts input to an integer

# .to_f

Converts input to a float
ex: 5 --> 5.0

# ARGV vs gets.chomp

Where is the input coming from?
Command line --> use ARGV
User input while script is running --> gets.chomp

# Functions

In Ruby you can create a function by using the word def for define

## Example

```
def cheese_and_crackers(cheese_count, boxes_of_crackers)
  puts "You have #{cheese_count} cheeses!"
  puts "You have #{boxes_of_crackers} boxes of crackers!"
  puts "Man that's enough for a party!"
  puts "Get a blanket.\n"
end
```

## Call the function (in multiple ways)

```
cheese_and_crackers(20, 30)

amount_of_cheese = 10
amount_of_crackers = 50
cheese_and_crackers(amount_of_cheese, amount_of_crackers)

cheese_and_crackers(10 + 20, 5 + 6)

amount_of_cheese = 10
amount_of_crackers = 50
cheese_and_crackers(amount_of_cheese + 100, amount_of_crackers)
```

# \*args

a lot like your argv parameter but for functions.

# irb

Like REPL but for Ruby, use it to test ruby

# Boolean shortcuts

- Any && expression that has a false is immediately false, so you can stop there.
- Any || expression that has a true is immediately true, so you can stop there.

# Increment Operator += / -=

Same as x = x + 1
Or x = x -1
